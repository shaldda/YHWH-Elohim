Let's look at the construction of "Word".
- the power and understanding of word

#### DEFINITION

- Not Torah, just the simplified meaning like "Love Your neighbour as yourself"

The strength of the word. With many words combine, you'll have a speech, words

#### Charataristics of word
```
- Word spin
- The word has/need unity, in order to operate - Gen 11
- Confirmation of minimal 2 people - Gen 11
- accomplishments - Gen 11
- Promise - Whenever you speak out a word, there's a certain **promise** attached to it. You expect it to come to fullfillment
- You **passes** on the word, it can be **generations**
- You have to understand the context
```
- Breath - Psalm 33:6 - When you speak out a word, a certain **breath** comes out


- "Word" is such a dynamic thing
       - why? 
              - When a word is spoken out, it requires a ear to listen and to make it effective it also needs a response. How sensitive are we to the word?
